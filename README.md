# Crypto-Portfolio-Updater

## Overview
Given the template Excel workbook and the relevent API Keys, this script will **automatically** collect your portfolio data from FTX, Binance and Metamask wallets and write to the workbook.
The workbook comes with graphs that automatically plot your portfolio return over time.


## How To Use
1) Fill in the workbook with the crypto ticker symbols you wish to track.
2) In *wallet_balance.py*, write in your **API_KEY**s and **SECRET_KEY**s for your FTX and/or Binance exchange and also your Metamask wallet address, if you decide to use that.
3) Run.

### Note
*Code is specific to workbook as the precise cells and layout must be known in order to successfully write data into the workbook.*
